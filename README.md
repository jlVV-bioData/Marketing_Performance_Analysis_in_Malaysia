## **RESUME**
In the competitive world of marketing, it is crucial to analyze and understand campaign performance to optimize strategies and maximize return on investment (ROI). This project focuses on analyzing the performance of various marketing campaigns conducted in Malaysia. Through data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, we seek to discover significant patterns and relationships between variables to extract valuable insights and formulate recommendations to improve the company's marketing strategies.

The dataset used in this analysis includes detailed information on campaigns, such as marketing channel, product category, geographic region, budget, spending, impressions, clicks, conversions, ROI, among others. Throughout this work, various data analysis techniques and tools will be applied to obtain a comprehensive view of campaign performance and provide data-driven recommendations for strategic decision making.

## **OBJECTIVE**
